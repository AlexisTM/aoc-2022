== Python

I thought about trying another language, but my youngest son is going to try his hand at AOC this year.
 And, so, I'll stick to Python.

Judging from the past, he has a good chance to get 1 star on a few of the first ones.

I'll post both solutions. :-) It'll be an adventure.

== Run script
Run the solution with `python solution.py`
