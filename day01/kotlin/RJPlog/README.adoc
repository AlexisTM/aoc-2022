=== First Star

How does it work: +

Inside function _calories_ the puzzle input is read and accumulated. Whenever a new block comes, the accumulated value is added to a list and the accumulation starts from new. The function takes one input parameter, if it is _1_ only the max value of the list with accumulated calories is returned

=== Second Star

How does it work: +

The same function call is used only with a different input parameter and therefore not the max value is returned but the sum of the three highest values
