== Day 1: Calorie Counting ==

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1[AoC|2022|1].

Nothing very interesting today.

=== Input ===

Parse everything in a vec of vecs (after having read instructions for part 1 and 2, vec of sums would have been sufficient)

=== Star 1 ===

Just find the biggest sum (I use `fold` instead of `max` to not handle the `Option::None` case)

include::src/lib.rs[tags=star_1]

=== Star 2 ===

Sum the three biggest sums. First solution used `Vec::sort`. New solution does not use any sorting and should be `O(n)`.

=== Tests ===

No tests today. It was too simple.

=== Today I learned ===

Not so much. My template works.
