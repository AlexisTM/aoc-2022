=== About me

I am a regular SW coder. Each year in december, I code AoC puzzle solutions. This year, for the 3rd year in a row, I'll go with Rust.

In my professional career, I used to do lots of Java and MATLAB coding, yet, this feels like very long time ago.

If I do not code or work, I enjoy https://www.strava.com/athletes/89256720[cycling] on or off roads, with or without electric support.
